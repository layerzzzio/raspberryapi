# From Paul Eggert (2015-05-02):
# This file contains a table of two-letter country codes.  Columns are
# separated by a single tab.  Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
# All text uses UTF-8 encoding.  The columns of the table are as follows:
#
# 1.  ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, current as of
#     ISO 3166-1 N976 (2018-11-06).  See: Updates on ISO 3166-1
#     https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/Open/16944257
# 2.  The usual English name for the coded region,
#     chosen so that alphabetic sorting of subsets produces helpful lists.
#     This is not the same as the English name in the ISO 3166 tables.
#
# The table is sorted by country code.
#
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time
# zone data appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not intended
# to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.
